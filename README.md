# Workshop Data Science & AI July-2022

In this repo I have saved all the NB used during the workshop in July22 (6 Rome, 7 Milan)

## Features and capabilities explored

* How to use a **custom conda** environment
* how-to **read data from ADWH**
* Tuning hyper-parameters using **ADSTuner**
* How to save an entire **Sklearn** pipeline to **Model Catalog**
* usage of the new ADS framework for **Model Serialization**
* Advanced usage of **Model Catalog**
* **Deploy** a Model directly using ADS (code)
* Usage of **ADS Feature Types**

## Feature Types

ADS has a very powerful and interesting framework to specify and check **Feature Types**.
In the Notebook [Complete Example with Feature Types]() I have used Feature Types to register which features are categorical and which continuous.
